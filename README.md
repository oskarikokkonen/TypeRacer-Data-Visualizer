# TypeRacer-Data-Visualizer

With this tool you can download your racing history to a CSV file and visualize it with a GUI graph

## How to Use 

By executing the object _chartUI_ in the file chartUI you can launch the graphical program <br /><br />
Before launching the GUI the program asks your TypeRacer username in the command line. After inserting your username correctly the program starts fetching your racing history which may take a while depending of the size of your racing history. <br /><br />
You can follow the fetching progress from the command line. <br /><br />
Next time you launch the program it only updates the history and doesn't fully download your history again.
